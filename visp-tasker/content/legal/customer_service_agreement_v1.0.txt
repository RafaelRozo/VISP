THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") IS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN
VISP TECHNOLOGIES INC. ("VISP", "WE", "US") AND THE CUSTOMER ACCEPTING
THESE TERMS ("CUSTOMER", "YOU") UPON YOUR FIRST USE OF THE VISP

     using the predefined task catalog. Free-text task descriptions
     are not available.
1.2. You will select the appropriate service category and task type
     that best matches your needs.
1.3. Upon submitting a service request, the Platform will match you
     with a qualified, verified independent service provider
     ("Provider") based on the task requirements, your location,
     Provider availability, ratings, and proximity.
1.4. You acknowledge that VISP does not employ the Providers and that
     VISP acts solely as a technology platform facilitating the
     connection between you and independent contractors.

2. PROVIDER LEVELS AND SERVICE QUALITY
2.1. The Platform classifies Providers into four levels based on their
     qualifications, certifications, and experience:

     licenses and maintain a minimum of $2,000,000 in commercial
     general liability insurance.

3. PRICING AND PAYMENT
3.1. The price for each service is determined by the Platform and
     displayed to you before you confirm the service request. The
     price is based on the task type, Provider level, estimated

     that reflects urgency, time of day, Provider availability, and

     an emergency service request. You must provide explicit consent
