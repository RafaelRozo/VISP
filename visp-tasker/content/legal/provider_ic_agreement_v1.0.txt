RECITALS
WHEREAS VISP operates the Tasker platform, a technology marketplace

the Provider wishes to offer services through the Platform as an
independent contractor;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained
herein, the parties agree as follows:

1. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS

     partner, or joint venturer of VISP. Nothing in this Agreement
     creates an employment relationship.
1.2. You are solely responsible for determining the manner and means
     of performing the services, subject to the quality standards and
     requirements of the Platform.

         applicable tax authorities (Canada Revenue Agency, IRS, or
         provincial/state tax agencies);
     (b) Remitting all applicable income taxes, self-employment taxes,
         HST/GST, and any other taxes or levies;
     (c) Maintaining appropriate tax registration (e.g., GST/HST

4.1. Services available through the Platform are defined by the closed
     task catalog. Providers may only perform tasks that match their

     additional services require a new job to be created through the

     qualifications, experience, and certifications.
5.2. Level assignment determines which tasks a Provider can accept
     and the applicable compensation range.

     violation of this Agreement and may result in immediate removal
     from the Platform.

6. COMPENSATION AND COMMISSION
6.1. Compensation for each task is determined by the Platform based on
     the task type, provider level, region, and applicable pricing rules.
