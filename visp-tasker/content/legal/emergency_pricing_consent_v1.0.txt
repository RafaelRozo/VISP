VISP/TASKER EMERGENCY DYNAMIC PRICING CONSENT
Version 1.0 — Effective Date: January 1, 2026

THIS EMERGENCY DYNAMIC PRICING CONSENT ("CONSENT") MUST BE ACCEPTED
BEFORE ANY LEVEL 4 EMERGENCY SERVICE REQUEST CAN BE PROCESSED. PLEASE
READ CAREFULLY AS EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO PREMIUM AND
VARIABLE PRICING.

1. DYNAMIC PRICING DISCLOSURE
1.1. Emergency services provided through the Tasker platform (Level 4)
     are subject to dynamic pricing. This means that the price you pay
     for an emergency service may be significantly higher than the
     standard rate for the same type of work performed as a non-emergency
     service.
1.2. Dynamic pricing factors include, but are not limited to:
     (a) Time of day: Services requested between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM
         local time are subject to overnight premiums;
     (b) Day of week: Weekend and statutory holiday requests carry
         additional premiums;
     (c) Provider availability: When fewer Providers are available in
         your area, prices may increase to incentivize response;
     (d) Urgency classification: The severity and urgency of the
         emergency as determined by the Platform's assessment;
     (e) Geographic factors: Distance of the nearest available Provider,
         travel conditions, and regional demand;
     (f) Seasonal demand: Extreme weather events and seasonal peaks
         may result in elevated pricing.

2. PRICING STRUCTURE
2.1. Emergency service pricing consists of the following components:
     (a) BASE RATE: Starting at $150.00 CAD per hour for the Provider's
         time on site;
     (b) EMERGENCY DISPATCH FEE: A flat fee charged for activating the
         emergency dispatch system (amount varies by service type);
     (c) AFTER-HOURS PREMIUM: An additional surcharge of up to fifty
         percent (50%) for services between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM;
     (d) HOLIDAY PREMIUM: An additional surcharge of up to one hundred
         percent (100%) for services on statutory holidays;
     (e) DYNAMIC MULTIPLIER: A variable multiplier of up to 3.0x
         applied to the base rate during periods of extreme demand or
         limited availability;
     (f) MATERIALS: Cost of any emergency materials or parts used,
         at market rates plus a handling markup.
2.2. The TOTAL ESTIMATED PRICE, including all applicable premiums and
     multipliers, will be displayed to you BEFORE you confirm the
     emergency service request. You must explicitly confirm acceptance
     of the displayed price.

3. PRICE GUARANTEE
3.1. Once you confirm an emergency service request at the displayed
     price, that price is locked as the maximum amount you will be
     charged for the Provider's time, subject to the following:
     (a) If the actual time on site is less than estimated, you will
         be charged only for actual time;
     (b) If the actual time exceeds the estimate by more than twenty
         percent (20%), you will be contacted for approval before
         additional charges are incurred;
     (c) Emergency materials and parts are billed at actual cost plus
         the markup disclosed at the time of booking.

4. COMPARISON TO STANDARD RATES
4.1. For transparency, the Platform will display the standard (non-
     emergency) rate for the same type of service alongside the
     emergency rate so you can understand the premium being charged.
4.2. You acknowledge that emergency rates may be TWO TO FIVE TIMES
     higher than standard rates for the same work, reflecting the
     24/7 availability, rapid response requirements, and on-call
     infrastructure costs.

5. YOUR RIGHT TO DECLINE
5.1. You are under no obligation to accept the emergency pricing.
     If you decline:
     (a) You may schedule the service at standard rates during normal
         business hours (subject to availability);
     (b) The Platform will display the next available non-emergency
         appointment time;
     (c) VISP is not responsible for any damage or loss that occurs
         between your decision to decline emergency service and the
         completion of a standard-rate service.

6. CANCELLATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES
6.1. Once an emergency Provider has been dispatched:
     (a) Cancellation before the Provider departs: Emergency dispatch
         fee applies (non-refundable);
     (b) Cancellation after the Provider departs but before arrival:
         Emergency dispatch fee plus a minimum one (1) hour charge at
         the emergency rate;
     (c) Cancellation after the Provider arrives: Full charges for time
         on site plus the emergency dispatch fee.
6.2. These cancellation terms apply regardless of the reason for
     cancellation, except in cases of force majeure.

7. PAYMENT AUTHORIZATION
7.1. By consenting to emergency pricing, you authorize VISP to place
     a pre-authorization hold on your payment method for the full
     estimated amount at the time of booking.
7.2. The final charge will be processed upon job completion and will
     reflect the actual time and materials used.
7.3. If your payment method cannot be pre-authorized for the
     estimated amount, the emergency request cannot be processed.

8. DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR EMERGENCY CHARGES
8.1. If you believe you were overcharged for an emergency service,
     you may file a pricing dispute within forty-eight (48) hours
     of service completion.
8.2. VISP will review the dispatch logs, Provider GPS data, time
     stamps, and job completion records to resolve the dispute.
8.3. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, a partial or full
     refund will be issued to your original payment method.

9. CONSUMER PROTECTION

     consumer protection legislation, including the Ontario Consumer
     Protection Act, 2002, and applicable US state consumer protection
     laws.

     law and maintains pricing records for audit and compliance.
